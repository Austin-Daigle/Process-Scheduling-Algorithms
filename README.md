# Operating Systems Process Scheduling Algorithms
This repo contains the different algorithms found in computer operating system process scheduling.

# How it works:
This program reads in a file and solves the process scheduling algorithm with the algorithm and data defined on the file. 
This program uses a directory path string as parameter run arguments. Check and update the runtime arguments prior to executing this program (jGRASP is an IDE that makes this process easy).

Instructions for jGRASP:
load both Process.java and ProcessScheduling.java into jGRASP, then in the "Build" Ribbon 

## This program supports the following process scheduling algorithms:
 * First Come First Serve
 * Shortest Remaining Time Next
 * Non-Preemptive Priority
 * Preemptive Priority
 * Shortest Job First
